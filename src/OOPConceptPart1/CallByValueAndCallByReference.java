        t.p = t.q;   //t.p = 60 after SWAPED it takes the value of q

                   //So the letter value on the RIGHT side (standard) of = EQUAL SIGN is assigned to the value on the left side of it (Rise to standard)

//        ***IQ: Is it possible to call by Reference in Java?
//        Ans: Yes, by using object references, basically we pass the Object Reference.

//
//        *IQ: What is the difference between call by VALUE and call by REFERENCE?
//
//        Ans: Call By Value: This is a parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to functionâ€™s formal parameters and the two types of parameters
//        are stored in different memory locations. So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in actual parameters of caller.
//
//        Call by Reference: Both the actual and formal parameters refer to same locations, so any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in
//        actual parameters of caller.
